A lightweight, functional, and composable framework for building AI agents that work together to solve complex tasks. 

Built with TypeScript and designed to be serverless-ready.

## Getting Started

It is very easy to get started. All you have to do is to create a file with your agents and workflow, then run it.

### Using `npx create-fabrice-ai`

Use our creator tool to quickly create a new AI agent project.

```bash
npx create-fabrice-ai
```

You can choose from a few templates. You can see a full list of them [here](./example/README.md).

### Manually

```bash
npm install fabrice-ai
```

#### Create your first workflow

Here is a simple example of a workflow that researches and plans a trip to Wroc≈Çaw, Poland:

```ts
import { agent } from 'fabrice-ai/agent'
import { teamwork } from 'fabrice-ai/teamwork'
import { solution, workflow } from 'fabrice-ai/workflow'

import { lookupWikipedia } from './tools/wikipedia.js'

const activityPlanner = agent({
  description: `You are skilled at creating personalized itineraries...`,
})

const landmarkScout = agent({
  description: `You research interesting landmarks...`,
  tools: { lookupWikipedia },
})

const workflow = workflow({
  team: { activityPlanner, landmarkScout },
  description: `Plan a trip to Wroc≈Çaw, Poland...`,
})

const result = await teamwork(workflow)
console.log(solution(result))
```

#### Running the example

Finally, you can run the example by simply executing the file.

**Using `bun`**

```bash
$ bun your_file.ts
```

**Using `node`**

```bash
$ node --import=tsx your_file.ts
```

## Why Another AI Agent Framework?

Most existing AI agent frameworks are either too complex, heavily object-oriented, or tightly coupled to specific infrastructure. 

We wanted something different - a framework that embraces functional programming principles, remains stateless, and stays laser-focused on composability.

**Now, English + Typescript is your tech stack.**

## Core Concepts

The framework is designed around the idea that AI agents should be:
- Easy to create and compose
- Infrastructure-agnostic
- Stateless by default
- Minimal in dependencies
- Focused on team collaboration

[TBD]

## Workflows

Workflows define how agents collaborate to achieve a goal. They specify:
- Team members
- Task description
- Expected output
- Optional configuration

## Agents

Agents are specialized workers with specific roles and capabilities. Each agent has:
- A defined role
- A clear description of capabilities
- Optional tools they can use
- A configured language model provider

### Creating Custom Agents

### Replacing Built-in Agents

## Providers

### Built-in Providers
TBD

### Using Different Providers
TBD

### Creating Custom Providers
TBD

## Tools

Tools extend agent capabilities by providing concrete actions they can perform. Tools are pure functions with:
- A description
- Typed parameters (using Zod)
- An execute function

### Built-in Tools
TBD

### Creating Custom Tools
TBD

### Using Tools

## Server-side Usage

### Serverless Deployment

### Long-running Operations
